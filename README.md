This is a machine learning SVM model that classfies a numerical phone info multiclassed dataset.
The output is an accuracy score , confusion matrix , precision score , specificity and ROC curve.
I tuned the training by choosing a penalty parameter C = 100 , a linear kernel , true probability and break ties and a random state = 50.
Every step has a comment above it explaining the use of it.
The dataset source is kaggle
